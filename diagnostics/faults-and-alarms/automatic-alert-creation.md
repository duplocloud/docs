# Automatic alert creation

DuploCloud allows automatic generation of alerts for resources within a Tenant. This makes sure that the defined baseline of monitoring is applied to all current and new resources based on a set of rules.

As an Administrator:

1. From the DuploCloud portal, navigate to **Administrator** ->**Tenants**, and click the **Alerting** tab
2. Enable alerting, this will open an alerts template which has rules for each AWS namespace and Metric to be monitored.
3. Review the alerts template, and adjust the thresholds
4. Click on **Update**
