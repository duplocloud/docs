# Kubernetes Overview

DuploCloud leverages [Kubernetes ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)as a foundational building block behind many of its managed Services.&#x20;

As DuploCloud supports Kubernetes Cluster enablement on all public cloud platforms, there are many Kubernetes objects and components that you can work with.

Use the topics in this section to implement many Kubernetes features with little or no hard coding, using DuploCloud's no-code/low-code approach.

For information about public-cloud provider-specific Kubernetes container features, see the [Kubernetes Containers documentation](../aws/aws-services/containers/eks-native-containers-and-services.md#kubernetes-containers) in AWS EKS, for example.
