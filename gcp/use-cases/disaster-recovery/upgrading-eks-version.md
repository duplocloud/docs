# Upgrading the GKE version

Google frequently updates the version of GKE based on new features that are available in the Kubernetes platform.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
DuploCloud pushes GKE upgrades to the DuploCloud Portal code, but we request that you contact the DuploCloud Support staff on your Slack channel or by email when upgrading, for the moment.
{% endhint %}

In future releases, this upgrade will be available for customers to install.
