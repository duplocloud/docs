# Application Deployment

DuploCloud supports many types of applications in AWS, including but not limited to:

* [Dockerized apps](../../aws/container-deployments/) constitute about 90% of our user workloads. The platform orchestrates containerized application deployments using GKE, Native/EKS, ECS, or built-in container orchestrations as defined in the [Container orchestration features](../container-deployments/container-orchestrators.md) section.
* Sage maker
* Glue&#x20;
