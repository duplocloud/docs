# Step 2: Tenant

Once the Infrastructure is created, then create a new Tenant (Administrator --> Tenants). Set the name as dev01 (the same name as the infrastructure we just created). You just need 2 inputs

* Name: dev01
* Plan: nonprod

It may take about 1-2 minutes for the Tenant to be set up. There might be a Fault that shows up under Administrator-->Faults, which is temporary, you can ignore it for the first 2 minutes as it should clear.
