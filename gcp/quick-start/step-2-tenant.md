# Step 2: Tenant

Once the Infrastructure is created, the next step is to create a new Tenant. From the DuploCloud portal, navigate to **Administrator** -> **Tenants**, and click Add. You just need 2 inputs:

* Name: dev01
* Plan: nonprod

It may take 1-2 minutes for the Tenant to be set up. While the Tenant is setting up, a temporary fault may show up under **Administrator** -> **Faults**. This fault can be ignored, as it should clear within the first 2 minutes.
