# Ingress Loadbalancer

Ingress controllers abstract the complexity of routed Kubernetes application traffic, providing a bridge between Kubernetes services and services that you define.

### Creating Tenants, Hosts, and Services

See the DuploCloud documentation on creating [Tenants](../../welcome-to-duplocloud/application-focussed-interface/tenant/), [Hosts](../../overview/use-cases/hosts-vms/), and [Services](../../welcome-to-duplocloud/application-focussed-interface/app-service-and-cloud-services.md) for your cloud provider.

Once your Service is deployed, you can add and configure Kubernetes Ingress. The steps to create Ingress for each cloud provider are slightly different.
