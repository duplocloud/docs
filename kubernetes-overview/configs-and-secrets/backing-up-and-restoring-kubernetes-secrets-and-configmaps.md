# Backing Up and Restoring Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps

DuploCloud provides automated infrastructure-level backups of Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps across all tenants. These backups support disaster recovery, helping ensure that critical configuration and secret data can be restored if a tenant or infrastructure is lost. They also protect against accidental deletion or modification and support manual restoration when needed. All backups are securely stored in AWS S3.

{% hint style="info" %}
Backup support for Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps is currently available only for **AWS**.
{% endhint %}

## Configuring Backups

Backups are configured via an infrastructure setting in the DuploCloud Portal:

1. Navigate to **Administrator** -> **Infrastructure**.
2. Select the Infrastructure you want to back up Secrets and ConfigMaps for in the **NAME** column.
3. Select the **Settings** tab.&#x20;
4.  Click **Add**. The **Infra - Set Custom Data** pane displays. \

5. In the **Setting Name** list box, select **Other**.&#x20;
6.  In the **Custom Setting** field, enter:&#x20;

    ```json
    ResourceBackupConfig
    ```
7. In the **Setting Value** field, enter:

```json
{ 
  "IsEnabled": true, 
  "IntervalInHours": "1", 
  "K8sResourceKinds": ["Secret", "ConfigMap"] 
}
```

8. Click **Set** to save the infrastructure setting.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: The backup interval must be at least 1 hour. The `IntervalInHours` parameter accepts values in whole hours only; decimals are not permitted.
{% endhint %}

## Accessing Backups

Backups are saved automatically at the configured interval in the following S3 bucket and path structure:

```
s3://backups-duplo-xx/YEAR/MONTH/DATE/xx/infra/INFRANAME/k8s/namespaces/TENANTNAMES/
```

Backups run automatically, reflect resource changes or deletions, persist even if tenants or infrastructure are deleted, and support multiple AWS regions. Backup operations are tracked in logs and AWS CloudTrail.

To restore Kubernetes Secrets or ConfigMaps from a backup, contact DuploCloud Support.
