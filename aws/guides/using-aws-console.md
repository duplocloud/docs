# Using AWS console

DuploCloud users get AWS console access for advanced configurations of S3, Dynamo, SQS, SNS Topic, Kinesis stream, and API Gateway resources that were created through DuploCloud. ELB and EC2 parts of console is not supported yet. You can click on the AWS console icon to take you directly to that resource in AWS console with permissions scoped to the current tenant/project. You don’t have permissions to create new resources directly from the AWS console. You need to do them in DuploCloud. You can do all operations on resources already created via DuploCloud. For example, you can create an S3 bucket from the DuploCloud UI and go to AWS console to add remove files, setup static web hosting etc. Similarly, you can create a DynamoDB in DuploCloud and use AWS console to add/remove entries in the table.
