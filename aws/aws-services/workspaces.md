# Workspaces

You can use [Amazon WorkSpaces](https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/faqs/) through DuploCloud to create individual workspaces/DevSpaces for users. WorkSpaces is a managed, secure cloud desktop service that can provision Windows, Amazon Linux, or Ubuntu Linux desktops. These workspaces have access to all the resources the user can access in the Tenant.&#x20;
