# DynamoDB

Create DynamoDB from under **DevOps > Database > DynamoDb tab > +Add** button above the table. The required permissions to access the DynamoDB from VM, Lambda functions and containers are provisioned automatically through Instance profiles and hence no Access key is required in the Application code. Application code should use the IAM role/Instance profile approach to connect to these services i.e., the AWS SDK constructor which only uses region should be used. More detailed configuration of the DynamoDB can be done directly in the AWS console which can be accessed by clicking on the Console `>_` icon. Within this login the user will have enough permissions to configure the desired application specific details of the DynamoDB. But no access or security level permissions will be provided.
