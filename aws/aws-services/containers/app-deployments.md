# Application Deployment

Applications can be of many forms. The following are common ones in AWS:

* [Dockerized apps](../../container-deployments/): This constitutes today 90% of our user workloads. The platform orchestrates containerized app deployments using EKS, ECS Fargate or a built-in container orchestration system as defined in the [previous section](../../container-deployments/)
* [Lambda Functions](../lambda/)
* [EMR ](../emr-serverless.md)Workloads
* AWS Batch
* Sage maker
* Glue&#x20;
