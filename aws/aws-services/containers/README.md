description: Using containers and DuploCloud Services with AWS EKS and ECS

# Containers and Services

## EKS/ECS support for containers and services <a href="#1-toc-title" id="1-toc-title"></a>

DuploCloud supports Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS/ECS) out of the box.&#x20;

Kubernetes clusters are created during Infrastructure setup using the **Administrator -> Infrastructure** option in the DuploCloud Portal. The cluster is created in the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) as the Infrastructure. Building an Infrastructure with an EKS/ECS cluster may take some time.&#x20;

Next, you deploy an application within a Tenant in Kubernetes. The application contains a set of VMs, a Deployment set (Pods), and an application load balancer. Pods can be deployed either through the DuploCloud Portal or through `kubectl,`using HelmCharts.

## DuploCloud Services and Containers <a href="#5-toc-title" id="5-toc-title"></a>

You can deploy native Docker containers in virtual machines (VMs) with the DuploCloud platform. Adding a Service in the DuploCloud Platform is not the same as adding a Kubernetes service.&#x20;

Deploying DuploCloud Services implicitly converts Services into either a deployment set or a StatefulSet. If there are no volume mappings, then the service is mapped to a deployment set. Otherwise, it is mapped to a StatefulSet, which you can force creations of if needed. Most configuration values are self-explanatory, such as **Images**, **Replicas,** and **Environmental Variables**.

### Advanced configurations with Kubernetes

You can supply advanced configuration options in the **Other K8 Config** field. The content of this field maps one-to-one with the Kubernetes API. Configurations for deployment are StatefulSets and are supported by placing the appropriate JSON code in the **Other K8 Config** section. For example, to reference Kubernetes Secrets using a YAML config map, create the following JSON code:&#x20;

```json
	"Volumes": [
		{
			"name": "config-volume",
			"configMap": {
				"name": "game-config"
			}
		}
	],
	"VolumesMounts": [
		{
			"name": "config-volume",
			"mountPath": "/etc/config"
		}
	]
}
```

## Displaying Services <a href="#7-toc-title" id="7-toc-title"></a>

Once the deployment commands run successfully, click the **Services** tile on the **Tenants** page. Your deployments are displayed and you can now attach [load balancers](../load-balancers.md) for the Services.

### Starting, stopping, and restarting multiple DuploCloud Services <a href="#7-toc-title" id="7-toc-title"></a>

Using the Services page, you can start, stop, and restart multiple services at one time.

1. In the DuploCloud Portal, navigate to **DevOps** -> **Containers** and select either **EKS/Native** or **ECS**.&#x20;
2. Click the **Services** tab.&#x20;
3. Use the checkbox column to select multiple services that you want to start or stop at once.
4. From the **Service Actions** menu, select **Start Service**, **Stop Service**, or **Restart Service.**

Your selected services are started, stopped, or restarted as you specified.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you create a service, refer to the registry configuration in **DevOps** -> **Containers** -> **EKS/Native** **| ECS** -> **Services**, in the **Configuration** tab. Note the values in the **Environment Variables** and **Other Docker Config** fields.&#x20;

For example:&#x20;

`{"DOCKER_REGISTRY_CREDENTIALS_NAME":"registry1"}`
{% endhint %}

## Managing Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS configs and Secrets <a href="#6-toc-title" id="6-toc-title"></a>

See the [Configs and Secrets](../../use-cases/passing-secrets/) section for information about creating and managing:

* Docker Registry Credentials
* Configuration and secrets in AWS
* Passing Kubernetes ConfigMaps as Environment Variables (EVs) and files.

### Downloading the Kubectl Token and KubeConfig <a href="#6-toc-title" id="6-toc-title"></a>

DuploCloud provides you with a Just-In-Time (JIT) security token, for fifteen minutes, to access the `kubectl` cluster.&#x20;

1. In the DuploCloud Portal, select **Administrator**-> **Infrastructure** from the navigation pane.&#x20;
2. Select the Infrastructure in the **Name** column.
3. Click the **EKS** tab.&#x20;
4. Copy the temporary **Token** and the **Server Endpoint** (Kubernetes URL) **Value**s from the Infrastructure that you created. You can also download the complete configuration by clicking the **Download Kube Config** button.
5. Run the following commands, locally:

```shell
> kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-cluster EKS_CLUSTER --server=[EKS_API_URL] --insecure-skip-tls-verify
```

```shell
> kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials tempadmin --token=[TOKEN]
```

```shell
> kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context EKS --cluster=EKS_CLUSTER --user=tempadmin --namespace=duploservices-[TENANTNAME]
```

```shell
> export KUBECONFIG=config-demo
```

```shell
> kubectl config use-context EKS
```

You have now configured `kubectl` to point and access the Kubernetes cluster. You can apply deployment templates by running the following command:

```shell
> kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
```

{% code title="nginx.yaml" %}
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment-g
  labels:
    app: nginx-deployment-g
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-deployment-g
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-deployment-g
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        tenantname: "duploservices-stgeast1"
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
{% endcode %}

If you need security tokens of a longer duration, create them on your own. Secure them outside of the DuploCloud environment.
