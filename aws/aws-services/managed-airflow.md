# Managed Airflow

Configure Apache Airflow by following the listed steps.

### Step1: Create S3 Bucket

Create a S3 bucket by following the steps [here](s3-bucket.md).

### Step2:  Upload DAGs in S3 **Bucket**

Package and upload your DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) code to Amazon S3. Amazon MWAA loads this code into Airflow.

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure Versioning is enabled for the custom plugins in a `plugins.zip`, and Python dependencies in a `requirements.txt` on your Amazon S3 bucket.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Refer to[ Amazon documentation ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/working-dags.html)on DAGs for more details.

### Step3:  Configure Airflow Environment

Navigate to **DevOps** > **Analytics** > **Airflow**

Provide the required information like airflow version, name, S3 bucket, DAGs folder location.

If Plugins.zip and requirements.txt is specified while adding airflow, you would need to provide the S3 Version of these files.&#x20;

User can also enable logs while creating airflow.
