# Upgrading the EKS version

AWS frequently updates the version of EKS based on new features that are available in the Kubernetes platform. DuploCloud automates this upgrade in the DuploCloud Portal.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**IMPORTANT: An EKS version upgrade can cause downtime to your application depending on the number of replicas you have configured for your services. Schedule this upgrade outside of your business hours to minimize disruption.**
{% endhint %}

### About the upgrade process

The upgrade process:

* Updates the EKS Control Plane to the latest version
* Relaunches all Hosts to deploy the latest version on all nodes.

After the upgrade process completes successfully, you optionally assign allocation tags to Hosts.

### Starting the upgrade&#x20;

To upgrade the EKS version, in the DuploCloud Portal:&#x20;

1. Click **Administrator** -> **Infrastructure.**
2. Select the Infrastructure that you want to upgrade to the latest EKS version.
3. Select the **EKS** tab. If an Infrastructure upgrade is available, **Upgrade** appears in the **Value** column.
4. Click **Upgrade**.
