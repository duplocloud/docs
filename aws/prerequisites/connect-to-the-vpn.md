# Connect to the VPN

DuploCloud integrates natively with OpenVPN by provisioning VPN users added in the Duplocloud portal. As a DuploCloud user, you can access resources in the private network by connecting to the VPN with the OpenVPN client.

{% hint style="info" %}
The OpenVPN Access Server is set to forward only traffic destined for network resources in the DuploCloud-managed private networks. Traffic accessing other resources on the internet does not pass through the tunnel.
{% endhint %}

## Obtain VPN Credentials

User VPN credentials are accessible on the user profile page. It can be accessed through the menu on the upper right of the page or through the User menu option on the left.&#x20;
