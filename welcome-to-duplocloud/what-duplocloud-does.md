# What DuploCloud Does

DuploCloud is a comprehensive solution for DevOps and SecOps, bringing Cloud Infrastructure management to businesses, regardless of DevOps expertise level.

DuploCloud uses templates to create Cloud infrastructures comprising hundreds of scaled, managed components. Microservices can be created in minutes, speeding up time to market. Advanced DevOps users can leverage Kubernetes and Terraform to create custom solutions.

Personalized onboarding, cloud migration, SecOps questionnaire completion, and auditing support are included for a flat rate per year.

If there is a way to do something in the cloud, it can be done faster and more efficiently in DuploCloud.

## 1. Turbo-charging Infrastructure and workspace creation <a href="#id-1.-turbo-charging-infrastructure-and-workspace-creation" id="id-1.-turbo-charging-infrastructure-and-workspace-creation"></a>

Did you know that DuploCloud can create a complete cloud infrastructure in ten to fifteen minutes, comprising virtually hundreds of components and sub-components that would take hours to develop in a native cloud portal and even longer when using native Kubernetes? Individual workspaces or Tenants can be created in less than a minute.

This acceleration is critical to many of the business value propositions DuploCloud offers. It is why we can perform cloud migrations at such an advanced pace, minimizing downtime and simultaneously ensuring security and compliance (and peace of mind).

## 2. Built-in scaling and managed services <a href="#id-2.-built-in-scaling-and-managed-services" id="id-2.-built-in-scaling-and-managed-services"></a>

Virtually all of the services DuploCloud supports are designed to auto-scale as your cloud environment grows exponentially (which they all do, eventually). These Managed Services further promote automated "set and forget" configurations that dovetail neatly into developer self-service.

As with creating Infrastructures and Tenants, DuploCloud Services are designed for the most common use cases. They enable users to supply a minimum number of inputs to get their service up and running quickly. At the same time, DuploCloud retains the ability to customize, using native Kubernetes YAML coding and custom scripts if needed.

Turnkey access to scalable Kubernetes constructs and managed services ensures minimal implementation detail, making DuploCloud the DevSecOps platform for the rapidly growing AI/ML cloud space. In this arena, the power of an automated platform becomes readily apparent, not only in setting up your cloud infrastructure but also in maintaining it.

DuploCloud’s ready-made templatized approach to K8s made adjustments to Kubernetes parameters, such as increasing the number of replicas or using Horizontal Pod Autoscalars (HPA) based on CPU and RAM requirements, which are simple to access and adjust.&#x20;

Remember that DuploCloud is not a replacement for DevOps engineers but rather an efficient, user-friendly means of helping them automate their environment, reducing the need for constant monitoring or "babysitting." More information on fewer screens and improved ease of navigation enhance monitoring performance.

## 3. Intuitive self-service DevOps for developers <a href="#id-3.-intuitive-self-service-devops-for-developers" id="id-3.-intuitive-self-service-devops-for-developers"></a>

DuploCloud's simplified UI guides developers and less savvy DevOps users in creating and managing DevOps components and constructs. Even advanced features such as AWS Batch, CloudFront, or setting up a Lambda function are simplified through a combination of procedural documentation, step-by-step UI panels, and even sample code blocks that can be accessed through info-tips in the UI.

Using a templatized approach, potentially complex Kubernetes constructs such as Ingress and Terraform scripting can be easily managed by developers with minimal exposure to such functionality. Experts who have invested time and money in creating custom solutions using such tools do not need to discard that work. DuploCloud can help integrate existing solutions and workflows, expediting and often automating them during onboarding, often at no additional cost.

Our website also features a comprehensive Chatbot ([Ask DuploCloud](https://duplocloud.com/ask-duplocloud/)) that can provide thorough answers and troubleshooting. Every DuploCloud customer receives their own Slack channel for personalized support from our responsive team of DevOps specialists.

## 4. Ease of use and expedited navigation with JIT access <a href="#id-4.-saving-time-through-ease-of-use-and-expedited-navigation" id="id-4.-saving-time-through-ease-of-use-and-expedited-navigation"></a>

Do you know that one of DevOps and cloud engineers' biggest headaches is complex navigation and workflows? Using DuploCloud, you can minimize the time they typically spend logging in and out of AWS, Azure, and GCP consoles. Every DevOps and SecOps task can be completed from within the DuploCloud portal, often with significantly reduced clicks.

Compare the keystrokes and navigation between DuploCloud and using a native cloud portal. Often, DevOps engineers "get used to the pain" inherent in many daily DevOps tasks, unaware they can gain back minutes, hours, and days by using DuploCloud.

Some commonly used tools that can be accessed directly within DuploCloud include `kubectl`, container logs, and JIT access to cloud consoles from within DuploCloud.

## 5. Turn-key compliance and security

When you let DuploCloud manage your DevOps environment, a scalable and robust SecOps framework and implementation strategy are included.  Aligned with industry best practices, our staff of SecOps experts analyzes how your data is stored and transmitted, helps identify the standards you must meet, and then constructs a detailed implementation strategy to meet and exceed those requirements, in addition to creating a scalable model that adapts as your customer base and workloads grow.&#x20;

DuploCloud walks you through each process step during onboarding, then ensures each implementation phase results in smooth and secure operations, laying the foundation for a reliable and compliant system. &#x20;

DuploCloud provides easy-to-access "Single Pane of Glass" dashboards that provide a granular view of all security issues and compliance controls. Completing questionnaires and passing audits is simple, especially with our 24/7 support.&#x20;

## 6. Seamless CI/CD pipeline integrations

DuploCloud supports all the primary [CI/CD tools](https://docs.duplocloud.com/docs/introduction-to-ci-cd) for creating automated, streamlined developer pipelines, ensuring consistent processes and repeatable workflows.

Some of the tools we support, such as GitHub Actions, include ready-to-run scripts for quickly creating Docker images, updating Services or Lambdas, uploading data to an S3 Bucket, or executing Terraform scripts.

Whatever your tool of choice, our DevOps experts can help you find the best workflow that requires the least effort to build and maintain.&#x20;

## 7. Optimizing DevOps Spending

One of the biggest reasons to consider an automated DevSecOps solution comes down to dollars and cents. It's too easy to spend a lot on a public cloud solution without knowing precisely where your money is going and if the components and services you've created (and even ones you've forgotten you've created) cost you more than they're earning you.

DuploCloud provides several billing dashboards that break down your spending by workspace and component. These dashboards are navigable with just a few clicks. Our support team can help you identify redundancies in services and tools and possibly cut costs by suggesting solutions leveraging the many third-party tools built into DuploCloud.

## 8. Scalable, simplified, faster Terraform scripting

As with most platforms, the work required to set up and configure a Terraform environment can adversely impact accuracy, productivity gains, and effectiveness. Crafting scalable Terraform requires more skills than simply programming. In addition, as with any code base, it requires constant updating, refactoring, and other maintenance tasks.

But the power of ready-made templates in DuploCloud works to your advantage. DuploCloud contains its own Terraform provider, which can access DuploCloud Cloud constructs such as [Infrastructure](https://docs.duplocloud.com/docs/getting-started/application-focussed-interface/infrastructure) and [Tenant](https://docs.duplocloud.com/docs/getting-started/application-focussed-interface/tenant). This simplifies the creation of many cloud resources by assuming defaults for compliance and security. When you run DuploCloud, you’re already speeding up the creation of DevOps components, so adding another accelerator based on Terraform is a win-win proposition: less code, less maintenance, faster deployments, and faster time-to-market.

Using DuploCloud’s proprietary Terraform provider removes the need to write specifically for one public cloud. You can effectively use the same DuploCloud Terraform code — as it maps to DuploCloud’s constructs, not one specific cloud — with several public clouds. You don’t need to worry about differentiating platform-specific specifications. DuploCloud handles all of this for you in a transparent, replicable manner. You use utilities such as DuploCloud’s Terraform Exporter to quickly clone Tenants and modify configuration details when needed for specific Infrastructures and Tenants.

## 9. Single Pane of Glass for enhanced observability

Attempting to monitor your cloud infrastructure from the numerous UIs offered by public providers often obscures problems or causes confusion. DuploCloud's monitoring interfaces combine multiple functionalities on one screen; our SIEM dashboard is a primary example of such flexibility and comprehensiveness. Leveraging Wazuh, DuploCloud offers unprecedented views from a single interface.

Using OpenSearch, Grafana, and Prometheus, you can get single snapshots of logging, auditing, compliance and security vulnerabilities, custom alerting, and fault lists with one click.

## 10. Cost-reduction leveraging DuploCloud Third-Party tools

DuploCloud utilizes numerous [third-party tools](https://docs.duplocloud.com/docs/extras-overview/supported-third-party-tools), which are included in the cost of a DuploCloud subscription. Depending on what tools you already use and the capacity in which you use them, a DuploCloud subscription can sometimes make the need for additional licenses obsolete. Our team of Solutions Architects can verify functional overlaps and suggest an optimal strategy to deliver the required functionality at the most efficient cost.
