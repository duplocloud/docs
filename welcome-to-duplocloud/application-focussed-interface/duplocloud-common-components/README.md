# DuploCloud Common Components

Several DuploCloud components are used with AWS, GCP, Azure, and hybrid/On-Premises Services. These include Infrastructures, Plans, Tenants, Hosts, and Load Balancers. To learn more, see the topics below.&#x20;

* [Infrastructure](infrastructure.md)
* [Plan](plan.md)
* [Tenant](tenant.md)
* [Services](app-service-and-cloud-services.md)
* [Diagnostics](diagnostics.md)

For the cloud-specific implementation of these components, see the [AWS Use Cases](../../../overview/use-cases/), [Azure Use Cases](../../../overview-2/use-cases/), and [GCP Use Cases](../../../overview-1/use-cases/).
