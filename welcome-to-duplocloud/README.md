# Getting Started with DuploCloud

DuploCloud manages cloud infrastructure in over two hundred organizations ranging from startup, small businesses to publicly listed companies. We categorize our clients into two segments:

* **Young companies** with little to no in-house DevOps expertise and very limited automation. Typically, these organizations want to completely revamp their DevOps stack and move to modern technologies like Kubernetes. In this scenario, DuploCloud is installed in a fresh cloud account, and the organization’s existing deployment is migrated to the new account using state-of-the-art automation, pipelines, security, observability, and compliance—supporting Kubernetes and serverless deployment models. Data sources like databases, S3 buckets, etc., are migrated to the new account or remain in existing accounts. The onboarding process is described in detail in the next section.
* **Mature organizations** with significant in-house DevOps expertise. Mature organizations must decide between operating in their existing account or migrating to a new account. If an organization wants to modernize, for example, migrating from VM to K8s, moving to a new account is the best option. However, if there is already a mature K8s automation stack, it may be imported into DuploCloud and mapped to the DuploCloud constructs described in the policy model. Most use cases in mature organizations involve leveraging AI to build AI DevOps teammates that help handle growing volumes of support tickets and reduce DevOps backlog, allowing human teams to focus on higher-value work.
