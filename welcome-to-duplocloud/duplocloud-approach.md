# DuploCloud Approach

DuploCloud is a DevOps-as-a-Service platform designed to simplify the management of cloud infrastructure while ensuring security and compliance across public cloud environments. It stands out by being a self-hosted, single-tenant software platform that integrates seamlessly within a customer's cloud account, catering to both technical and non-technical users.

The platform operates by taking three high-level inputs:

1. High-Level Application Architecture, as previously explained.
2. Compliance Standard that is required, such as SOC 2, PCI, HIPAA, etc.
3. Public Cloud Provider where the application will be deployed.

With these inputs, DuploCloud automatically generates the necessary lower-level configurations that adhere to security and compliance requirements. This process ensures that all best practices and compliance controls are integrated. Users benefit from standard functions like central logging, monitoring, and reporting dashboards available right out of the box, enhancing the platform's usability and efficiency.

DuploCloud's unique offering includes a comprehensive suite of logging, monitoring, alerting, and reporting features, significantly reducing the coding effort required for cloud infrastructure management. Users have the flexibility to interact with the system using a no-code user interface or a low-code Terraform provider. The latter enables automation with significantly less code—up to 10x less—compared to using native Terraform, making it accessible for users with minimal DevOps skills. This Terraform provider allows for the configuration of cloud infrastructure using DuploCloud's constructs, simplifying the complexity typically associated with cloud providers' lower-level constructs.

By streamlining the deployment and management of cloud infrastructure, DuploCloud ensures that organizations can maintain security and compliance without compromising on ease of use. It serves as a versatile tool in the DevOps landscape, accommodating a wide range of user expertise.
