# DuploCloud Approach

DuploCloud is a software platform that only requires three high-level inputs:

1. High-level application architecture.
2. Compliance standards, like SOC 2, PCI, HIPAA, etc.
3. Public cloud provider where the application will be deployed.

With the above inputs, the platform can automatically generate the required lower-level configurations that are compliant and can be used by end users like engineers and DevOps alike. All the best practices and compliance controls are baked in. Standard functions like central logging monitoring and reporting dashboards are available out of the box.

Users interact with the system using a no-code UI or a low-code Terraform provider. The Terraform provider enables the user to achieve the same automation with 10x less code, requiring less DevOps skills than native Terraform.
