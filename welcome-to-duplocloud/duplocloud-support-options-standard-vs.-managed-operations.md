# DuploCloud Support Options: Standard vs. Managed Operations

## **DuploCloud Support Services**

DuploCloud offers two levels of support designed to meet different customer needs: Standard Support, and Managed Operations. All customers receive Standard Support. Teams needing deeper operational assistance can upgrade to Managed Operations. For more details, see [the DuploCloud Pricing page](https://duplocloud.com/pricing/).

### **Standard Support**&#x20;

Standard Support is designed to enable your internal teams to effectively operate cloud infrastructure with confidence, while leveraging DuploCloud’s automation and best practices. This support level ensures timely help with questions, troubleshooting, and implementation guidance.

**What’s Included:**

* **24×7 Access**&#x20;
  * Available via Slack or Microsoft Teams for real-time communication.
  * Ideal for initiating support requests, troubleshooting issues collaboratively, or asking quick questions.
  * Responses are handled by DuploCloud’s experienced support engineers, ensuring fast and informed assistance.
  * Issues are logged and tracked in a dedicated ticketing system.
* **Support Scope:**&#x20;
  * **CI/CD Pipelines**\
    Guidance on integrating and managing pipelines for continuous integration and deployment workflows.
  * **Infrastructure Automation**\
    Support for setting up and modifying infrastructure components automated by DuploCloud, including networks, security policies, and containerized workloads.
  * **Cloud Provisioning**\
    Help with resource creation and management across AWS, Azure, or GCP by using the DuploCloud platform.
  * **Deployment Troubleshooting**\
    Diagnosis and resolution of errors or misconfigurations in application and infrastructure deployments.
  * **Best Practice Guidance**\
    Consultation on DevOps workflows, cloud architecture, and regulatory compliance to align with industry and platform standards.
* **Service Level Agreements (SLA)**
  * DuploCloud provides responsive support for all critical issues and best-effort assistance for general queries, typically within a few business hours depending on severity and complexity. Customers with urgent or escalated issues can flag them via chat using Slack or Microsoft Teams, or a provided escalation email address.

**Standard Support** is designed for teams who want direct access to knowledgeable engineers without the need for fully managed operations. It is especially well-suited for engineering-led teams that prefer to maintain operational control while getting help when and where they need it.

### **Managed Operations**

**Managed Operations** is DuploCloud’s premium support offering, designed for organizations seeking full-service operational management of their cloud infrastructure. This service builds on what’s included in Standard Support and is available as an add-on. You’ll work with named DevOps engineers who provide proactive, hands-on management and operate as an extension of your internal engineering and DevOps teams.

**What’s Included:**

* **Dedicated DevOps Support**
  * Work directly with DuploCloud experts who understand your infrastructure, compliance posture, and operational goals.
  * Communicate via a shared Slack or Teams channel for faster collaboration and resolution.
* **Custom Statement of Work (SOW)**
  * Every Managed Operations engagement is tailored to your organization. We collaborate with you to define a **custom SOW** that outlines the services, deliverables, and responsibilities aligned with your priorities.
  * The SOW can include **any of the areas listed below** — such as infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD automation, observability, security enforcement, and compliance support.
    * **Cloud Infrastructure**
      * Provision and manage cloud resources across environments.
      * Monitor system health, availability, and security posture.
      * Enforce policies and align with industry best practices.
    * **Application & Workload Support**
      * Deploy and manage workloads through the DuploCloud platform.
      * Support for service migrations and CI/CD pipeline integration.
      * Configure infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Terraform) as needed.
    * **Observability & Reliability**
      * Implement and manage logging, monitoring, and alerting.
      * Automate backups and support periodic Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Planning (BCP) exercises.
    * **Cloud Cost Optimization**
      * Analyze cloud resource usage and spending trends.
      * Recommend and implement cost-saving strategies.
    * **Security & Compliance Support**
      * Conduct annual penetration tests and provide findings with remediation plans.
      * Assist with audits and assessments.

If you need to offload day-to-day cloud operations or ensure best-practice implementation at scale, **Managed Operations** delivers that through hands-on support, compliance reinforcement, and platform optimization.
