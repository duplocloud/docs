# Tags and Label

Several security and compliance framework mandate that resources be labelled based on their sensitivity. In the platform the user can set labels at the tenant level and that will automatically propagate down to all the resources, existing and new. This is described [here](../aws-user-guide/use-cases/custom-resource-tags.md).&#x20;
