# Tags and Label

Several security and compliance frameworks mandate that resources be labeled based on their sensitivity. In the platform, users can set labels at the Tenant level, which will automatically propagate to all the existing and new resources. This process is described in detail [here](../aws-user-guide/use-cases/custom-resource-tags.md).&#x20;
