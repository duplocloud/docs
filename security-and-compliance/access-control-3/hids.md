Host intrusion detection is implemented using ossec and integrated into the SIEM. Agents installed by DuploCloud will combine anomaly and signature-based technologies to detect intrusions or software misuse. They can also be used to monitor user activities, assess system configuration, and detect vulnerabilities.
