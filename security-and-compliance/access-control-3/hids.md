# HIDS

A Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) is implemented using OSSEC and integrated into the DuploCloud SIEM dashboard. Agents installed by DuploCloud combine anomaly and signature-based technologies to detect intrusions or software misuse. They can also monitor user activities, assess system configuration, and detect vulnerabilities.
