# Inventory Reports

DuploCloud allows AWS users to generate an inventory report of their cloud resources directly from within the DuploCloud Platform. This is particularly useful for meeting StateRAMP compliance report requirements as it includes all required resource details.

## Downloading an Inventory Report

1. From the DuploCloud Portal, navigate to **Administrator** -> **Inventory**. The **Inventory** page displays.&#x20;
2. Select the **All Resources** tab.
3. Click **DuploCloud Inventory Report** on the upper right. An inventory of all resources automatically downloads for your records or compliance reporting.
