# Introduction to Security and Compliance

DuploCloud offers a number of metrics and reporting tools to ensure your cloud installation is protected against viruses and malware, and hacker-proofed, in addition to meeting a number of compliance standards, such as SOC2, PCI, and HIPAA.

When you use DuploCloud, you no longer have to verify and update your environment due to additions and changes in Security Control rulesets. Using a dynamically updated rules database, you are notified of any variances in compliance and security standards, each assigned a severity priority, for you to address at your convenience.

Use the documentation in this section to learn more about the various dashboards available to you and how to work with them.
