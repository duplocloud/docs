# Kubernetes Access

The platform enables access to every tenant's namespace that the user has access to. It provides a kubeconfig that is temporary and requires a SSO authentication.  The permissions are scoped to the kubernetes namespace. For admin K8S access same principle applies to admin kubeconfig available from under administrator ->infrastructure -> K8S. See here for detailed [instructions](../../kubernetes/kubectl-setup/kubectl-token.md)
