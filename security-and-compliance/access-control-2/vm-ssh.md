# VM SSH

Just-in-time Access to VM shell is supported for AWS and GCP. Behind the scenes the platform orchestrates AWS SSM and GCP console access features to achieve this. Users can connect to the shell from Cloud services -> Nodes -> (select the VM) -> Actions -> Connect SSH as shown below. In case of Azure user should launch into the Azure console for the VM and then in the left nav bar choose the connect option. \
