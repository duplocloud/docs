# Encryption At Rest

DuploCloud generates a cloud provider specific encryption key for each tenant. While creation of resources it encrypts them either with generic cloud provider key or the user has an option to choose a separate key per tenant. Users can also create their own encryption keys and add them under Administrator --> Plan --> KMS and those can be used to encrypt resources at rest.&#x20;
