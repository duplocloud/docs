If you are using GRPC tools like Vanta, Drata, Security Frame, Thouroughpass or any others, then by leveraging DuploCloud you will find all infrastructure checks go green in a matter of a few days. You can assign the failing tests to DuploCloud support personnel and they can ensure the completion. If you are an AWS environment and using Vanta we have an out-of-box integration that will enable all controls Vanta is looking for as described [here](../aws-user-guide/security-configuration-settings/vanta-compliance-controls.md) &#x20;
