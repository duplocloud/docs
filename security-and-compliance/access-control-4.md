# Compliance Frameworks

The core benefit of the DuploCloud Platform is accelerated and out-of-box compliance with various standards. We sit in on 100+ audits for our customers every year. The platform covers every aspect of cloud configuration. The most commonly audited frameworks we come across are SOC2, HIPAA, HITRUST, PCI, NIST, StateRamp, ISO, and GDPR.&#x20;

* [HIPAA](https://duplocloud.com/white-papers/pci-and-hipaa-compliance-with-duplocloud/#Control-by-Control\_HIPAA\_Implementation\_Detail)
* [HiTrust](https://duplocloud.com/white-papers/pci-and-hipaa-compliance-with-duplocloud/#Control-by-Control\_HITRUST\_Implementation\_Detail)

If you are using GRC tools like Vanta, Drata, Secureframe, Thoropass, or any others, leveraging DuploCloud will make all infrastructure checks go green in a matter of a few days. You can assign the failing tests in your GRC tool to DuploCloud support personnel, who can ensure their completion. If you are in an AWS environment and using Vanta, we have an integration with AWS that will setup the configuration and tags on AWS resources that Vanta is looking for, as described [here](../overview/security-configuration-settings/vanta-compliance-controls.md).
