# Compliance Frameworks

DuploCloud platform's core benefit is accelerated and out-of-box compliance to various standards. We sit in 100+ audits for our customers every year. Every aspect of cloud configuration is covered by the platform. The most commonly audited frameworks we come across are SOC2, HIPAA, HiTrust, PCI, NIST, StateRamp, ISO and GDPR.&#x20;

If you are using GRPC tools like Vanta, Drata, Security Frame, Thoropass or any others, then by leveraging DuploCloud you will find all infrastructure checks go green in a matter of a few days. You can assign the failing tests to DuploCloud support personnel and they can ensure the completion. If you are an AWS environment and using Vanta we have an out-of-box integration that will enable all controls Vanta is looking for as described [here](../aws-user-guide/security-configuration-settings/vanta-compliance-controls.md).
