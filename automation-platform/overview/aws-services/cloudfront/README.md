# CloudFront

[Amazon CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html) is a global content delivery network (CDN) that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to users with low latency and high transfer speeds. You can manage CloudFront Distributions, Functions, and Key-Value Stores directly from the DuploCloud Portal.

* [Distributions](cloudfront.md): Configure and manage CloudFront distributions, origins, cache behaviors, and error responses.
* [Functions](cloudfront-functions.md): Create lightweight JavaScript functions that run at CloudFront edge locations to customize viewer requests and responses.
* [Key-Value Stores](cloudfront-key-value-stores.md): Manage key-value data used by CloudFront Functions for advanced logic like geo-targeting or personalized redirects.
