# Tenant Access for Users

Tenant access in DuploCloud defines which tenants a user can view and manage. Access is assigned through user roles, tenant permissions, and group memberships, allowing you to control resource visibility and operational scope within the platform.

* [Give a User Tenant Access](give-a-user-tenant-access.md) – Assign a tenant to a user so they can view and manage resources in that tenant.
* [Cross-Tenant Access](../../../security-and-compliance/access-control-2/cross-tenant-access.md) – Configure cross-tenant permissions.
* [Add Tenant Access over a VPN](../../../security-and-compliance/access-control-2/add-tenant-access-over-a-vpn.md) – Grant access to a tenant’s resources through a VPN connection for secure remote management.
* [Readonly Access to a Tenant ](read-only-access-to-a-tenant.md)– Configure view-only permissions so a user can see tenant resources without making changes.
