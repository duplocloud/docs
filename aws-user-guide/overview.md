# AWS overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you begin, read through the [DuploCloud Platform Overview](../) and are familiar with DuploCloud terms such as [Infrastructure](../getting-started/application-focussed-interface/infrastructure.md), [Plan](../getting-started/application-focussed-interface/plan.md), and [Tenant](../getting-started/application-focussed-interface/tenant/).
{% endhint %}

The DuploCloud platform installs in an EC2 instance within your AWS account. It can be accessed using a web interface, API, and a Terraform provider.&#x20;

Log in to the DuploCloud portal, using single sign-on (SSO), with your GSuite or O365 login.&#x20;

## Prerequisites

Before getting started:&#x20;

* Set up the DuploCloud Portal and ensure that you have [access to it](../user-administration/access-control/).
* Connect to the DuploCloud Slack channel for support from the DuploCloud team.&#x20;
