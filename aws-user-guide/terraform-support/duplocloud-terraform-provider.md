# DuploCloud Terraform Provider

The DuploCloud provider offers resources for seamless interaction with the DuploCloud API, facilitating the management and automation of cloud infrastructure. For users transitioning from AWS CloudFormation, the DuploCloud onboarding team assists in migrating to a DuploCloud-based infrastructure setup. This transition involves replacing existing CloudFormation Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with configurations managed through the DuploCloud UI or automated via DuploCloud Terraform using the DuploCloud Terraform Provider. Post-onboarding, customers can fully leverage DuploCloud's capabilities without the need to write or maintain CloudFormation templates, streamlining their cloud management processes.
