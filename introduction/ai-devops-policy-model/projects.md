# Projects

A Project is a logical entity representing planned work. Each Project contains a Title and Summary.. The heart of a Project is its requirements, which are organized into sections covering Infrastructure, CI/CD, Workloads, Observability, Compliance, Security, and Cost. Projects can optionally define their own Scope as a subset of the Engineer's Scope, defaulting to the Engineer's full Scope if not specified.&#x20;
