# Projects

A Project is a logical entity representing planned work. Each Project includes a Title and Summary. The heart of a Project is its requirements, which are organized into Infrastructure, CI/CD, Workloads, Observability, Compliance, Security, and Cost. Projects can optionally define their own Scope as a subset of the Engineer's Scope. If no custom Scope is specified, the Project defaults to using the Engineer’s full Scope.
