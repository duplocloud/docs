# Incident Management

An Incident is a logical entity for handling unplanned work. Each Incident includes a Title and Alerts or Context (sourced from incident management systems or manually input). Incidents are assigned to a team, owned by a user who is responsible for oversight, and tracked with Start Time and End Time, marked by users. During an Incident, the Agent collects Background Information and generates Root Cause Analysis to support resolution efforts.
