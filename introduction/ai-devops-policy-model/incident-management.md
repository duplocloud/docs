# Incident Management

An Incident is a logical entity for handling unplanned work. Each Incident includes a Title and Alerts or Context, which may come from incident management systems or be manually input. Incidents are assigned to a Team and have an Owner designated by a user. They track Start Time and End Time as marked by users, and the agent collects Background Information and generates Root Cause Analysis to support resolution efforts.
