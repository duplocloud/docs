# MCP Servers

MCP Servers provide an AI Engineer with access to essential external systems and tools that aren't directly part of cloud infrastructure or code repositories. This includes observability platforms (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog), SIEM tools, ticketing systems, communication platforms, and specialized DuploCloud integrations.

**Note:** Scopes let you fine-tune the Engineer’s access. When creating or editing an Engineer, you can attach scope definition files (YAML or JSON) that specify the resources and permissions the Engineer is allowed to access.
