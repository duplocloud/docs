# MCP Servers

MCP servers provide the AI engineer with access to essential external systems and tools that aren't directly part of cloud infrastructure or code repositories. This includes observability platforms (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog), SIEM tools, ticketing systems, communication platforms, and specialized DuploCloud integrations.



To add MCP servers to the Engineer's scope, follow these steps:&#x20;



**Step 1:** Go to MCP Servers from the left menu and click “Add Server”

Scopes let you fine-tune the engineer’s access. Attach scope files (YAML or JSON) when setting up or editing an engineer, specifying the resources and permissions allowed.&#x20;
