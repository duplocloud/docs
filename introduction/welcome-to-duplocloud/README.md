# Getting Started with DuploCloud

DuploCloud manages cloud infrastructure in over two hundred organizations ranging from startup, small businesses to publicly listed companies. We categorize our clients into two segments:

* **Young companies with little to no in-house Devops expertise** and hence have very limited automation in place. Many a times the organizations are completely revamping their devops stack moving to modern technologies like Kubernetes. In this segment, DuploCloud is installed in a separate fresh cloud account and the existing deployment is migrated over with state of art automation, pipelines, security, observability and compliance operating on either Kubernetes or serverless deployment model. Datasources like databases, S3 buckets etc are mostly also migrated but many a times they continue to stay in existing accounts. The onboarding process is described in detailed here in the next section.
* **Mature organizations with significant in-house Devops expertise.** Here the choice of operating in the existing account vs a migration to new account depends on wether there is a modernization goal in play especially say migrating from VM to K8S. If we are migrating to K8S it is always desired to move to new account but if there is already a mature K8S automation stack then they are just imported into DuploCloud and mapped to DuploCloud constructs described in the policy model. Majority of use cases in mature organizations are around leveraging AI such that it Devops teams can build AI Devops Teamates to deal with increasing load of support tickets and accomplish the Devops backlog.
