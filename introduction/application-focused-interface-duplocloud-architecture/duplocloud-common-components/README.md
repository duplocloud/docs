# DuploCloud Common Components

Several DuploCloud components are used with AWS, GCP, Azure, and hybrid/On-premises Services. These include Infrastructures, Plans, Tenants, Hosts, and Load Balancers. This section provides a conceptual explanation of the following common DuploCloud components:

* [Infrastructure](../infrastructure.md)
* [Plan](../plan.md)
* [Tenant](../tenant.md)
* [Services](../app-service-and-cloud-services.md)
* [Diagnostics](diagnostics.md)

For instructions to implement these common components in your DuploCloud account, see the  documentation for your cloud provider:

* &#x20;[AWS Use Cases](../../../overview/use-cases/)
* [Azure Use Cases](../../../automation-platform/overview-2/use-cases/)
* [GCP Use Cases](../../../automation-platform/overview-1/use-cases/)
