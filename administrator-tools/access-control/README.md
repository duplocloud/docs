# Access control

The DuploCloud Portal contains the following roles:&#x20;

* An **Administrator** has access to all Tenants plus access to administrative functions like Plan configuration, system dashboards, system defaults, etc.
* A **User** is a regular user that can be given access to a specific Tenant. A Tenant can be accessed by multiple users and a user can be given access to multiple Tenants.
* The **Security** role is for security and compliance auditors, in order to verify security and compliance dashboards and reports.
* The **Signup** role is for users who create and manage DuploCloud resources via API.

### Single Sign On (SSO)

The user name is meant to be an email address associated with an Identity provider. Currently supported identity providers are Google and Microsoft Azure. Once a user is created in the DuploCloud portal, the user receives an account-creation email with login instructions. No passwords are involved, the user simply has to navigate to their DuploCloud environment and use SSO to login to their account.
