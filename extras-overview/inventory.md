# Inventory

The Inventory page in DuploCloud provides a centralized view of all cloud resources across your environment, providing a quick way to see everything you have deployed in one place.

You can use the Inventory page to:

* Locate resources without navigating through multiple tenants or service pages.
* Verify that deployments have completed.
* Cross-check counts across services.
* Audit your environment for troubleshooting or compliance purposes.
* Export a full inventory of cloud resources for recordkeeping or compliance needs.

For Host-level security inventory collected via OSSEC and visible in the SIEM dashboard, see the [**Inventory Monitoring** documentation](../security-and-compliance/access-control-3/inventory.md) in the **Security and Compliance** section.
{% endhint %}

## Accessing the Inventory Page

The Inventory page displays a full list of resources for recordkeeping, troubleshooting, or compliance purposes.
