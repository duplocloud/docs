# Okta user management

Okta is a cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) platform that enables you to manage user authentication, authorization, and user lifecycle management across various applications and services. It provides a centralized solution for identity management, securely connecting users to your applications and data regardless of the cloud provider or the technology stack being used.

DuploCloud supports Okta as a source for user authentication and authorization for Administrator and User roles, as well as permissions to view and manage DuploCloud tenants.
