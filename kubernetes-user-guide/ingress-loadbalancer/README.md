# Ingress Loadbalancer

Ingress controllers abstract the complexity of routed Kubernetes application traffic, providing a bridge between Kubernetes services and services that you define.

### Creating Tenants, Hosts, and Services with EKS

See the [Containers ](../../aws/aws-services/containers/)topic for steps on how to create [Tenants](../../getting-started/application-focussed-interface/tenant/), Hosts, and [Services](../../getting-started/application-focussed-interface/app-service-and-cloud-services.md).

Once your service is deployed, you are ready to add and configure Kubernetes Ingress. There are slightly different steps to create ingress in each of the cloud.
