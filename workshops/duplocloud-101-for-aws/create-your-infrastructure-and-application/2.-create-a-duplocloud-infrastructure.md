# 2. Create a DuploCloud Infrastructure

{% hint style="info" %}
This step may be performed by the DuploCloud team before the workshop.
{% endhint %}

In the DuploCloud Portal, navigate to **Administrator -> Infrastructure -> Add** and enter the following details:

* **Name**: `non-prod`
* **Region**: `us-west-2`
* **VPC CIDR**: `10.221.0.0/16`
* **Subnet CIDR Mask**: `24`
* **Availability Zones**: `2`
* Select the **Enable EKS** option

This takes about 20 minutes. Once itâ€™s ready, double-check that a DuploCloud Plan (**Administrator** -> **Plans**) has been created with the same name (**`non-prod`**).
