# MySQL Server database

{% hint style="danger" %}
Azure Database for MySQL Single Server has been deprecated. You can no longer create a database with MySQL Single Server. Use [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli) to create a new MySQL Single Server instance.
{% endhint %}

## Viewing database details

In the DuploCloud Portal, navigate to **DevOps** -> **Database** -> **MySQL** to view database details, reboot, delete a database, and perform supported actions by selecting the MySQL instance you created, from the Name column on the **MySQL** page.
