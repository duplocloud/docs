# Workspaces

Individual workspaces/Devspaces can be created for the user in DuploCloud. These workspaces will have access to all the resources in the tenant which user has access. To create a workspace go to **Administrator > Users > Select user > Devspace** tab.

Once the workspace is created, it can be accessed from the Code next to Diagnostics.
