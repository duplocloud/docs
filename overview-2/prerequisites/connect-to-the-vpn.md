# Connect to the VPN

DuploCloud integrates with OpenVPN by provisioning VPN users added to the DuploCloud Portal. As a DuploCloud user, you can access resources in the private network by connecting to the VPN with the OpenVPN client.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **OpenVPN Access Server** forwards traffic only to network resources within the DuploCloud-managed private networks. Any traffic intended for other resources on the internet does not pass through the VPN tunnel.
{% endhint %}

## Obtaining VPN Credentials

User VPN credentials are accessible through the user profile page.&#x20;

1.  In the DuploCloud Portal, navigate to **Administrator** -> **Users** and select your user name, or click on the person icon (<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot (347) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">) in the upper-right corner, and select **Profile**.\
