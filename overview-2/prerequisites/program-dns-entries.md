description: Add DNS entries for DuploCloud Services to use your domain names

# Program DNS entries

Before you use DuploCloud for Azure, a subdomain-hosted zone must be created to program DNS entries so DuploCloud services can access your specific domain names. Public and private DNS zones are supported. In addition, keys must be added to the DuploCloud configuration that map to the needed DNS entries. Reach out to DuploCloud support staff to accomplish these tasks.&#x20;

Once the DNS entries are configured, you can use your existing domain names with DuploCloud.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to add your DNS entries, contact DuploCloud via email or by using your private Slack channel.  Our support staff guides you through the process and assists you with completing other prerequisites in this section, such as providing CRT files and private keys for [importing SSL certificates](import-ssl-certificates.md).
