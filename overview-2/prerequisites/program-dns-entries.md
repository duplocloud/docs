# Program DNS Entries

If you plan to use custom domain names with DuploCloud-hosted services, a subdomain-hosted zone must be created to program DNS entries so DuploCloud services can access them. Public and private DNS zones are supported. In addition, keys must be added to the DuploCloud configuration that map to the required DNS entries. To complete these tasks, contact DuploCloud via email or by using your private Slack channel. Our support staff will assist you in completing this and other prerequisites.

Once the DNS entries are configured, you can use your existing domain names with DuploCloud.

For more info about DNS setup and custom DNS names, see the [DNS Configuration documentation](../../duplocloud-prerequisites/resolving-dns-failures.md).&#x20;
