# Azure Billing and Cost Management

The DuploCloud Portal allows you to view and manage cloud resource usage costs. As an administrator, you can view your organizationâ€™s billing data by month, week, or Tenant. Non-administrator users can access billing data for Tenants they have permission to view. You can also configure billing alerts, analyze historical usage trends, and view DuploCloud license usage.
