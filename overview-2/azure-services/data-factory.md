# Data Factory

DuploCloud supports integration with Azure Data Factory (ADF)--a fully managed cloud-based data integration service from Microsoft Azure. It enables users to create, schedule, and orchestrate data workflows, allowing for the movement and transformation of data across a wide variety of sources and destinations. It provides a platform for managing data pipelines, which are used to move and transform data from on-premises or cloud-based sources into data storage systems for analysis, reporting, and other business processes.
