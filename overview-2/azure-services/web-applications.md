# Serverless

Serverless services in Azure let you run applications and functions without managing infrastructure. DuploCloud supports:

* [**App Service Plans and Web Apps**](web-applications/app-service-plans-and-web-apps.md): Host code-based or containerized web applications with built-in scaling and deployment options.
* [**Function Apps**](functions.md): Run lightweight serverless functions triggered by events, timers, or HTTP requests.
