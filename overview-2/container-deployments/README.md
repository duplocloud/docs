# Container Deployments

Approximately 90% of workloads deployed on DuploCloud run in Docker containers. The platform orchestrates these containerized applications using **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** or **DuploCloud's built-in orchestration engine**, which offers a simpler alternative to Kubernetes.

On Microsoft Azure, DuploCloud supports many application hosting options, including AKS, Azure WebApps, and native Docker containers. This flexibility allows users to leverage the most appropriate orchestration model for their workloads while working within a cloud-neutral interface.

DuploCloud also supports a wide range of application types beyond containers. If you need support for a custom Service, please contact the DuploCloud support team. The typical turnaround time is one business week.
