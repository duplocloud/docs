# Overview

DuploCloud’s AI Agents simplify and automate repetitive DevOps tasks, acting as your always-on **AI DevOps Engineer** that understands your infrastructure and context. Built on DuploCloud’s unified automation platform, they automate core functions across compliance, provisioning, migrations, and observability scenarios. Agents provide guidance and take real action, leaving you in control of change approvals. This human-in-the-loop approach allows your Agents to handle complex workflows, optimize CI/CD pipelines, resolve incidents, and manage environments intelligently at scale. All actions are executed with built-in security and out-of-the-box compliance, keeping your environments secure, compliant, and fully operational.

While the AI Agents provide a conversational interface to the AI DevOps Engineer, the DuploCloud Platform simplifies and automates complex or repetitive DevOps tasks. You simply define the high-level specifications, and DuploCloud turns them into secure, compliant, and reliable infrastructure—delivering speed and precision without sacrificing control.

The following diagram illustrates how DuploCloud orchestrates these capabilities.&#x20;

The platform provides multiple customer interfaces — the DuploCloud AI HelpDesk, DuploCloud AI Studio, DuploCloud Platform UI, the DuploCloud Terraform provider, and DuploCloud APIs — while all data and configurations remain within your cloud account. Every configuration generated by DuploCloud can be reviewed and, if needed, edited directly in your environment.

Having this level of support and control empowers your team to quickly tackle even the most complex DevOps tasks more confidently and efficiently than ever before.
