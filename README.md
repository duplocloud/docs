# Overview

DuploCloud is a platform that enables security and compliance for engineers and operators in organizations that host infrastructure on the public cloud.&#x20;

You provide high-level application specifications, including cloud services, application containers, packages and configurations, interconnectivity, requirements for multiple environments, and scoped compliance standards. DuploCloud uses these specifications to auto-generate required lower-level configurations, provisioning them securely and compliantly while maintaining their ongoing operations.&#x20;

In addition, the provisioned system's logging, monitoring, alerting, and reporting are enabled. The following figure shows the platform's various functions.

DuploCloud is a single-Tenant software platform installed in the customer's cloud account. The customer interfaces with DuploCloud via the browser UI, the DuploCloud Terraform provider, and/or API calls while the data and configuration stay within the customer's cloud account. All configurations created and applied by DuploCloud can be reviewed and edited in the customer's cloud account.
