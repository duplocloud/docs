# EC2 Snapshots

EC2 snapshots provide point-in-time backups of virtual machine volumes for AWS-based hosts, allowing you to protect data and recover from issues such as misconfigurations or disk failures. You can create and manage snapshots for EC2-based hosts directly from the DuploCloud Portal.

## Creating an EC2 Snapshot

1. In the DuploCloud Portal, navigate to **Cloud Services** → **Hosts**.
2. Select the **EC2** tab.
3. From the **NAME** column, select the Host you want to backup.
4.  Click **Actions** → **Host Settings** → **Create Snapshot**.\

5. Click **Confirm** to confirm that you want to create the snapshot.
