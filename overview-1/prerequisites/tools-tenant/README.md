# Tools Tenant

Lets add a tools tenant where we will have tools like Kubectl shell, Open Telemetry stack and so forth One can name the tenant with any desired name and can also choose to split the desired tools to separate tenant.

Here we create a new tenant called "tools" and place it in the infrastructure we just created in the "First Infrastructure Setup" step. Navigate to administrator --> Tenants and click on add and create this tenant. Typically it takes a few minutes so wait for 2-3 minutes.

Next we will deploy the Kubectl Shell in this tenant.
