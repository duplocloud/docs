# Upgrading the GKE version

Google frequently updates the version of GKE based on new features available in the Kubernetes platform.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
DuploCloud pushes GKE upgrades to the DuploCloud Portal, but we request that you contact the DuploCloud Support staff on your Slack channel or by email when upgrading, for the moment.
{% endhint %}

In future releases, upgrades will be available for customers to install.
