# Advanced Observability Suite

DuploCloud's Advanced Observability Suite (AOS) is an add-on service crafted to boost your monitoring and troubleshooting abilities. Built on OpenTelemetry, our AOS leverages Prometheus and Grafana to deliver robust, real-time observability for your cloud infrastructure. It includes real-time anomaly detection and customizable alerts and unifies metrics, traces, logs, and profiles to easily track all aspects of your environment. The Grafana-powered dashboards can be customized to spotlight key metrics and visualize trends in real-time, empowering swift, data-driven decisions. DuploCloudâ€™s AOS simplifies troubleshooting and enhances system health by providing a holistic view of your application and infrastructure performance.

### OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is an open-source project from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) that supports multiple programming languages and environments. It provides a flexible, vendor-neutral framework for monitoring and analyzing application performance. Designed for high scalability, OpenTelemetry is ideal for distributed applications and helps reduce costs by using open-source components instead of expensive proprietary systems. See the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/) for more. &#x20;

##





**Customizing Dashboards**



## **Configuring Alerts**

Set up alerts for key observability metrics (e.g., high CPU or memory usage) to be proactively notified of potential issues.

1. From the DuploCloud Portal, navigate to the Admin AOS Dashboard (**Administrator** -> **Observability** -> **Advanced** -> **Dashboard**) or the Tenant AOS Dashboard (**Observability** -> **Advanced** -> **Dashboard).**
2. Click the Alert icon ()near the upper right in the **Observability** header.
3. The Grafana **Alert rules** page displays, allowing you to view, add, delete, or modify alerts. For more, see the [Grafana alert documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/alerting-rules/).&#x20;

## Additional Functions

From the Grafana console, you can perform a variety of tasks to customize your observability experience and proactively manage system health. For additional information, see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/).&#x20;

## Use Cases

### Real-Time Monitoring and Observability

* **System Health Check**: Track real-time metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and error rates across services to ensure that applications are healthy.
* **Latency Tracking**: Monitor request latencies to identify performance bottlenecks, particularly in services where latency spikes might indicate an issue.
* **Error Rate Analysis**: Track error counts and types to ensure services operate as expected and identify critical failure points.

### End-to-End Tracing and Dependency Mapping

* **Request Flow Visualization**: Visualize the path of requests through different services to understand interdependencies and identify which services may contribute to slowdowns or failures.
* **Service Dependency Mapping**: See which services interact with each other, allowing for a clear view of critical service dependencies and helping identify potential cascading failures.
* **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Trace issues back to the source by identifying slow, failed, or error-prone transactions and drilling down to pinpoint problematic services or infrastructure.

### Performance Optimization

* **Identify Performance Bottlenecks**: Detect slow components, such as long-running queries, network delays, or overloaded services, and make data-driven decisions to optimize them.
* **Capacity Planning**: Use metrics to analyze usage patterns, forecast demand, and optimize resource allocation, helping avoid over-provisioning or under-resourcing.
* **Compare Release Impact**: Measure the impact of new releases on system performance by comparing metrics before and after deployments.

### Alerting and Incident Management

* **Set Alerts for Key Metrics**: Define thresholds and set alerts for anomalies in critical metrics, such as high error rates or slow response times, so that teams can act quickly.
* **Incident Response and Remediation**: Enable responders to access context-specific insights that accelerate incident response, diagnostics, and resolution times.
* **Service-Level Agreement (SLA) Monitoring**: Track SLA compliance metrics, such as uptime and latency, to ensure the system meets contractual obligations.

### User Experience Insights

* **Track User Journey Metrics**: Analyze performance metrics specific to different user journeys (e.g., checkout flows) to understand the impact of backend performance on user experience.
* **End-to-End Latency Perceptions**: Collect latency and success metrics for critical user actions to help understand where improvements could enhance user satisfaction.

### Security and Compliance Monitoring

* **Detect Anomalous Behavior**: Set up alerts on unusual patterns or outliers in metrics that could indicate potential security incidents.
* **Audit Logging**: Track API call/sensitive event logs (e.g., login attempts) to assist in compliance reporting and security auditing.

### Custom Business and Operational Metrics

* **Monitor Business KPIs**: Track custom metrics like transaction success rates, revenue per minute, or user engagement rates to tie technical performance to business outcomes.
* **Cost Optimization**: Identify underused resources or inefficient services to optimize operational costs and improve infrastructure utilization.
