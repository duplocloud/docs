# Dashboards

The Duplocloud dashboard is a gateway to various detailed OpenTelemetry dashboards. It serves two purposes:

* SSO and Authentication Proxy: The Grafana dashboards are on a private network. DuploCloud acts as an authentication layer connecting the same single-sign on that is the DuploCloud login to a Grafana session.
* &#x20;Summarizing Links: While we may have published many dashboards in Grafana. Users can create quick links with description to the most relavant ones &#x20;

The Admin AOS Dashboard (Administrator -> Observability -> Advanced -> Dashboard) displays cloud data across all resources, while the Tenant AOS Dashboard displays data for a specific Tenant (Observability -> Advanced -> Dashboard). &#x20;
