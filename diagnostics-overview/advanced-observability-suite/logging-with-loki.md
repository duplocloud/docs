# Logging with loki

Loki is the backend for logging setup with Grafana as the visualization tool. Alloy is the collector that collects the logs.

DuploCloud orchestrates the configuration such that it automatically inserts meta data like tenant name, namespace, container, host etc.

Links can be setup from logs to go to traces and then metrics
