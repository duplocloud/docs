# Automatic alert creation

DuploCloud allows automatic alert generation for resources within a Tenant. This ensures that the defined monitoring baseline is applied to all current and new resources based on a set of rules.

## Creating an Alert

As an Administrator:

1. From the DuploCloud portal, navigate to **Administrator** -> **Tenants**, and click the **Alerting** tab
2. Enable alerting, this will open an alerts template which has rules for each AWS namespace and Metric to be monitored.
3. Review the alerts template and adjust the thresholds.
4.  Click **Update.**\
