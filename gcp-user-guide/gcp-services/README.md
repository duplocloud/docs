# GCP Services

DuploCloud provides several configurable components when running Google Cloud Provider's Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

Applications involve GCP Services such as Cloud Armour, Redis and SQL databases, Storage Buckets, Load Balancers, and so on.&#x20;

Using DuploCloud, you can create unlimited Services within each Tenant, using application-centric inputs. At the same time, the platform ensures that the lower-level nuances are programmed to best practices for security and compliance.&#x20;
