# DuploCloud Support Model

DuploCloud offers hands-on 24/7 Support for all customers via Slack or email as part of your subscription. Automation and Developer Self-Service are the heart of the DuploCloud platform.  We are dedicated to helping you achieve hands-off automation in the fastest time possible, via rapid deployment of managed service or customized Terraform scripts using our exclusive Terraform provider.

## How to contact DuploCloud for support

* Use the customer Slack channel created during the Onboarding process.

### What DuploCloud does not support or supports conditionally

Very little is not supported by our staff of DevOps professionals, and some features and functions we can help troubleshoot, but do not monitor. These include:

* Patching an application inside a Docker image
* Monitoring alerts in a Network Operations Center (NOC)&#x20;
