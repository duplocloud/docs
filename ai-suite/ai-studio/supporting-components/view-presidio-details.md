## Duplo Presidio

The **Duplo Presidio Service** is a wrapper built on top of [Microsoft Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/) that enhances its ability to detect and protect sensitive data by supporting **custom recognizers and anonymizers**.

This ensures that secrets, tokens, passwords, and credentials are automatically identified and anonymized before data leaves your Duplo-managed Kubernetes cluster. By disabling irrelevant recognizers and introducing project-specific patterns, we reduce noise and improve accuracy.

### üìÇ Structure of the ConfigMap

Presidio is configured through a **YAML-based ConfigMap**.\
This config controls global flags, disabled built-in recognizers, and custom recognizers that we add.

Example (simplified from our deployment):

```
config: |
  global_regex_flags: 26
  supported_languages:
    - en

  # Disable unnecessary built-in recognizers
  disabled_recognizers:
    - DateRecognizer
    - UrlRecognizer
    - DomainRecognizer
    - EmailRecognizer
    - PersonRecognizer
    - LocationRecognizer

  # Example custom recognizers
  recognizers:
    - name: GitHubTokenRecognizer
      type: custom
      supported_entity: GITHUB_TOKEN
      patterns:
        - name: github_token_pattern
          regex: \b(ghp_[0-9a-zA-Z]{36})\b
          score: 0.95

    - name: PrivateKeyRecognizer
      type: custom
      supported_entity: PRIVATE_KEY
      patterns:
        - name: rsa_private_key_pattern
          regex: -----BEGIN\s+(?:RSA\s+)?PRIVATE\s+KEY-----[\s\S]*?-----END\s+(?:RSA\s+)?PRIVATE\s+KEY-----
          score: 0.99
```

### üîé Built-in Recognizers

Presidio ships with a rich set of **built-in recognizers** for detecting common forms of sensitive data (PII). These recognizers are enabled by default and cover global as well as region-specific entities.

üëâ See the full list of built-in recognizers here:\
[Presidio Supported Entities](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/supported_entities/)

#### Examples of Built-in Recognizers

* **EmailRecognizer** ‚Üí detects email addresses
* **PhoneRecognizer** ‚Üí phone numbers
* **UrlRecognizer** ‚Üí web URLs
* **IpRecognizer** ‚Üí IPv4/IPv6 addresses
* **CreditCardRecognizer** ‚Üí credit card numbers
* **UsSsnRecognizer** ‚Üí U.S. Social Security Numbers
* **PersonRecognizer** ‚Üí human names
* **IbanRecognizer** ‚Üí IBAN bank account numbers\


### ‚úÇÔ∏è Built-in Anonymizers

While **recognizers** detect sensitive data, **anonymizers** transform or redact that data to protect it. Presidio comes with several built-in anonymizers that can be applied when sanitizing text.

#### Common Anonymizers

* **replace** ‚Üí Replaces detected entity with a placeholder (e.g., `<ENTITY_TYPE>`)
* **mask** ‚Üí Masks characters with a symbol (e.g., `****1234`)
* **redact** ‚Üí Removes the detected entity entirely
* **hash** ‚Üí Hashes the entity value (SHA256 by default)
* **encrypt / decrypt** ‚Üí Encrypts or decrypts values using AES
