# Bring Your Own Agent

While DuploCloud's built-in agents operate on a wide range of standard cloud functionalities you can build your agents that are very custom to your own use cases and stitch together your organization's tool set and workflows. For example you can build an agent that can triage your customer support tickets by connecting to your Zendesk and cloud infrastructure tools.
