# AI Suite

DuploCloud AI Suite is an advanced platform that transforms DevOps operations through purpose-built AI agents that augment your existing infrastructure management capabilities. Designed to address the complexity of cloud operations and the scarcity of specialized DevOps expertise, AI Suite intelligently automates routine and complex tasks while maintaining a human-in-the-loop approach for critical decisions. The solution seamlessly integrates with your existing infrastructure and tooling, creating a secure collaborative environment between AI agents and human operators.

The AI Suite consists of two primary components: [AI Studio](ai-studio/) and [AI ServiceDesk](ai-servicedesk/). AI Studio enables the building, training, and deployment of specialized agents for various DevOps functions including deployments, observability, CI/CD, security, and incident management. AI ServiceDesk provides an intuitive interface where end users can open tickets, interact with agents, visualize operations through a shared browser, and maintain oversight of AI-executed commands in production environments. Together, these components deliver a comprehensive solution that enhances productivity, reduces operational overhead, and maintains the security and compliance standards intrinsic to the DuploCloud platform.
