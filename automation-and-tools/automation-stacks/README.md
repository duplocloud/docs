# Automation Stacks

DuploCloud's Stacks feature is a no-code/low-code solution for importing, replicating, and managing resources across cloud environments. DuploCloud Stacks empowers users to replicate resources quickly and easily, minimizing onboarding time and reducing reliance on niche expertise.

Stacks supports a variety of use cases, from importing resources from external cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Azure into the initial DuploCloud environment to replicating resources within the DuploCloud Platform. It facilitates iterative imports, allows granular scope selection for resources, and supports both form-based and JSON-based edits to customize configurations.
