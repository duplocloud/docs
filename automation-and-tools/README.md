# Automation and Tools

The ability to efficiently manage and interact with your resources is paramount in cloud computing. Just as Kubernetes provides Kubectl, Google Cloud offers gcloud CLI, and AWS supplies AWS CLI, DuploCloud delivers its powerful command line interface: [DuploCtl](duploctl.md). This Python-based CLI is your gateway to seamless interaction with DuploCloud-integrated services.&#x20;

The DuploCloud Portal integrates with numerous [third-party tools](supported-third-party-tools.md) to provide diverse functionality at a lower cost and time investment.&#x20;
