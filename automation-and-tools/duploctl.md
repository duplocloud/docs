# Duploctl

## DuploCtl Overview

In cloud computing, the ability to efficiently manage and interact with your resources is paramount. Just as Kubernetes provides Kubectl, Google Cloud offers gcloud CLI, and AWS supplies AWS CLI, DuploCloud delivers its own powerful command line interface:[ DuploCtl](https://cli.duplocloud.com/). This Python-based CLI is your gateway to seamless interaction with DuploCloud-integrated services. [Download the latest version of DuploCtl here.](https://cli.duplocloud.com/Installation/)

[DuploCtl](https://cli.duplocloud.com/) is more than just a tool; it's the backbone of DuploCloud’s [CI/CD](https://docs.duplocloud.com/docs/introduction-to-ci-cd) ecosystem and the source from which all DuploCloud-supported CI/CD tools are derived. If you're a DuploCloud user working in a [CI/CD](https://docs.duplocloud.com/docs/introduction-to-ci-cd) environment, DuploCtl is your central access point to leverage the strengths and features of multiple CI/CD tools and manage your workflows in a unified way.&#x20;

By giving you the flexibility to interact with the DuploCloud API directly from your local terminal, [DuploCtl ](https://cli.duplocloud.com/)allows you to execute commands locally with precision and control. And for those looking to push the boundaries of automation, DuploCtl's Python-based framework provides the tools you need to create custom integrations and automations tailored to your unique needs.

[DuploCtl](https://cli.duplocloud.com/Home/) is a versatile and powerful tool that enhances cloud management, development efficiency, and process automation. With DuploCtl, you're not just interacting with the cloud—you're taking command of it.
