## DuploCtl Overview

[DuploCtl](https://cli.duplocloud.com/) is more than just a tool; it's the backbone of DuploCloud’s [CI/CD](https://docs.duplocloud.com/docs/introduction-to-ci-cd) ecosystem and the source of all DuploCloud-supported CI/CD tools. If you're a DuploCloud user working in a [CI/CD](https://docs.duplocloud.com/docs/introduction-to-ci-cd) environment, DuploCtl is your central access point to leverage the strengths and features of multiple CI/CD tools and manage your workflows in a unified way.&#x20;

By giving you the flexibility to interact with the DuploCloud API directly from your local terminal, [DuploCtl ](https://cli.duplocloud.com/)allows you to execute commands locally with precision and control. For those looking to push the boundaries of automation, DuploCtl's Python-based framework provides the tools you need to create custom integrations and automation tailored to your unique needs.

[DuploCtl](https://cli.duplocloud.com/Home/) is a versatile and powerful tool that enhances cloud management, development efficiency, and process automation. With DuploCtl, you're not just interacting with the cloud but taking command of it.
